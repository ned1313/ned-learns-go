# Day 0 - May 22, 2024

Today I created this repository and wrote the README. I also started working through the first item in the study guide: [A Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1).

My first impression is that A Tour of Go is aimed at a seasoned programmer who is looking to understand how Go does things. It runs through the syntax and data structures, but doesn't explain what any of them are or why you would use them.

For example, pointers. Why would I use a pointer? How are they better/worse than using the original variable? I'm sure a professional developer would know the answer. I do not.

TBH, even though I have a CS degree and did some programming. But that was back in 2006 and using C# and .Net 1.0. Since then, the closest thing I've done to programming is writing PowerShell scripts and Terraform configurations. Not that those don't count as programming, but they are significantly different than writing applications in Python or Go.

I think I am going to ditch "A Tour of Go" and try something more rudimentary. Pluralsight has a Go Fundamentals course that looks attractive.
