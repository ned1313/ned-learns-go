# Day 3 - May 25, 2024

As promised, I spent about an hour working on the Pluralsight course for Go.

## Actual Stuff

In the course we covered writing a CLI program and a basic web application. I also got to learn about the Debugger in VS Code, which I've basically never used before. You don't really use the Debugger for HCL and Terraform or Markdown and that's 99% of what I do.

We also started getting into more complex data structures like arrays and slices. Slices are a little confusing to me, but they're starting to come together. Now I get that a slice is always referring back to an array construct. When you make a change to a slice element, that changes the underlying element in the array.

Copying a slice just creates a new pointer to the array. At least I think so. What if I create a smaller slice from an existing slice? Does that change the original slice size. If I change an element of the smaller slice, does it change the element of the larger slice.

Can I create a copy of the underlying array and assign it to a new slice? So many questions! I can answer of lot of these just by playing around, but I think I'm done for today.

Next time I'm going to try some more experiments and start digging into maps and for loops.
