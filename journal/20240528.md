# Day 3 - May 28, 2024

Monday was Memorial Day, so I didn't Go. I went. To a parade and a cookout. Now it's Tuesday and it's time to learn Go again.

## Actual Stuff

Made a lot of solid progress today. I finished out the collection types in Go by checking out maps and structs. Funny story. A couple of years ago I was trying to add a new built-in function in Terraform having to do with datetime stuff. The feedback from my PR was that I should try and create a struct. But I didn't know what a struct was and I ended up never getting the function added because I couldn't figure it out. They're actually super simple and I feel a little silly now.

After collections, I moved on to looping and conditionals. I ran through for loops, if/else, and switch statements. I like that Go doesn't have a do/while loop. Those always seemed a little silly to me. I stopped just before deferred functions, panic/recover, and goto. Go has goto?! Seems like a terrible idea. Guess I'll find out tomorrow.

At this rate, I should finish the Pluralsight course on Monday next week.
