# Day 1 - May 23, 2024

Today didn't start great as I am fighting with my webcam and microphone setup for a recording later today. There's 150ms of consistent lag for video processing, which means I need to shift my audio 150ms to compensate. But the Master Output Delay setting on my RodeCaster Duo doesn't seem to work. So... that's fun.

## Actual stuff

After 30 minutes of fighting my A/V setup, I'm finally moving over to doing some Go learning. I'm jumping into the Pluralsight Go Fundamental course from Mike Van Sickle. I jumped ahead to the "Your first Go Program". I finished the two modules "Getting Up and Running" and "Variables and Simple Data Types."

A few things I noticed for these modules:

- Initializing go with `go mod init` and the name of the module
- Go will not do implicit type conversion
- Integer division will deliver an integer result, no remainder
- `iota` is super weird and seems only occasionally useful, maybe I'm wrong
- Pointers seem dangerous. Is there a read-only pointer? That seems like it might be useful.
- You can declare multiple variables using `var()` but I don't know if that's ever helpful

I had to add 30 minutes at the end of the day to make up for my A/V problems. Tomorrow I'll try and tackle the next two modules in the Pluralsight course.
