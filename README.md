# Ned Learns Go

My CS advisor would be so proud.

## What?

Ned (that's me) needs to learn how to program in Go. This repository is a record of Ned trying to do that.

## Why?

Terraform mostly. But I feel like I should get back into the programming world after spending the last 20 years focused on infrastructure and ops.

## How?

I put up a post on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ned-bellavance_it-might-finally-be-time-ive-put-it-off-activity-7198659404630474754-2Cza?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) and got a ton of suggestions. Here's the current list:

My plan is to spend an hour each day working through these study materials. I have blocked out 9AM every weekday, since I think I learn best in the morning.

## When?

I'm starting this on May 23, 2024. We'll see how long I stick with it and how long it takes.

## Sooooo, what is this repository?

I think that I'm going to use it to track my progress through each study material. I'm not sure exactly how that will work. Maybe I could write a quick 5 minute summary each day, kind of like a journal, covering what I learned and from where.
